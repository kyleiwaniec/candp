                    <div class="col2">   My 1st column might have content resulting in e.g. a 400px height, though it could be less or more.
                        My 2nd column is a bunch of text data, perhaps document excerpts, that could be a line or two, or hundreds of lines. In the latter case, what I get is *all* hundreds of lines and the height of my is x-hundreds of px.
                        What I'd like to do is limit the height of column 2 to be no taller than column 1 and, if there is more to display, have a scroll-bar on the 2nd column. The way I've shown it doesn't work.
                        I'm open to any ideas: frames? position?

Humid and dark, the night grips you in a tight embrace. 
Through a small window, in a dimly lit room,
You can see the disease.
It reeks of foul play.
There she is.

And you - wailing like a banshee for her soul.
Your hands grasp your face, 
Your nails claw at your skin.
Your crow's nest hair all tangled 
And winding around you like vines,
Is falling out at your sides.

And sitting at the bedside,
The helpless fool, full of shame and regret.

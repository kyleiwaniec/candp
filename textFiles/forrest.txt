circa 1980/present
There again watching the distance. Starring into it as if to find answers to some irrelevant questions, or are they relevant, you tell me, you're the doctor. Your office walls are covered in forrest wallpaper. But your forrest is different from mine. Mine was mostly evergreens. Mine held the promise of wild blue berry picking in the summer at the risk of being eaten by ants who also liked berries; but a more sinister fear prevailed should you suddenly find yourself alone in a luscious patch of raspberry bushes, in the dark, you see a figure pass in front of you in a dark open overcoat. The trees freeze in time, voices become stoned, there's that distance again, right up in your face___This forest is very different from the one on your wall, it's mostly pine trees and sandy floor. It goes from fields of poppy flowers and rows of pillions, to enclaves of dark humid intimacy where it all gets lost somehow. That's when my feeling goes away. That's when time freezes over. The suspense of disbelief sets in. I can't see past so I look inside and what I see inside isn't much. I'm waiting for it all to be over. In retrospect, as innocent, as tragic, as brutal, as sick, as hopeless, in the moment it is only petrifying. I could keep staring into this forrest outside my window. I could wander and berrypick and swim in its streams at the risk of being forgotten. Because I am already forgotten.

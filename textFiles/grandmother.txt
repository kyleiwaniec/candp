There are moments when all your senses shut down.
And for the first time you pray.
Not with words or pictures or icons.
You pray nobody can see.
You pray.
Somewhere in the untraversed waters of your mind there is a sixth sense - complete and utter desperation.
And you pray.

How can you love someone and find them so repulsive
That your your body recoils and you gasp for air as you choke on your own vomit.
Love them unconditionally, and hate them for the wrongs they have trespassed against you.
Can you love them so much you know when their time has come?
Can you hate them so much, you know, without evidence, they have passed on?
And the answers to your questions can never be exhumed.

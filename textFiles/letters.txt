Somebody stop me!
I have a confession to make,
But I just keep rolling. Carefully,
I formulate the words into sentences each morning.
But the letters keep slipping through my fingers.
I take refuge in slumber, self inflicted,
I lie.
In my sleep I review my confessions.
Carefully I formulate the words into sentences,
But the letters keep slipping through my fingers.
